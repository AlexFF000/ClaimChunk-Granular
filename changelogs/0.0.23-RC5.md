# ClaimChunk 0.0.23-RC5

Changes:
* Downgrade to Java 16 (Java 17 becomes too restrictive for older version support)
  * It should be noted that ClaimChunk will always try to be up-to-date with Spigot or Minecraft API changes. Generally, new versions should support the previous release or two, but unless major issues arise, there aren't likely to be updates for older versions of the game.
* Make some internal structural changes (Most APIs should be safe, but be sure to double-check that things still function as intended.
* Disable debug spam being overridden in versions with an extra marker (such as snapshot or RC).
* Add `my_remaining_claims` placeholder that displays the number of claims a player can make
  * (Provides the value of `my_max_claims - my_claims`)

Main remaining changes that need to be made before 0.0.23 is fully released:
* Proper PvP support (the current support doesn't leave much to customizability). 

As always please report any bugs (or minor changes that may still need to be made) you find to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cjburkey01/ClaimChunk/issues) or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/swW8xX665Z).
