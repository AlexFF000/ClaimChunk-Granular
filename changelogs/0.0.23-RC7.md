# ClaimChunk 0.0.23-RC7

Changes:
* Add translation keys for command arguments.

Main remaining changes that need to be made before 0.0.23 is fully released:
* Proper PvP support (the current support doesn't leave much to customizability). 

As always please report any bugs (or minor changes that may still need to be made) you find to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cjburkey01/ClaimChunk/issues) or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/swW8xX665Z).
