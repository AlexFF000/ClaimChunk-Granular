# ClaimChunk 0.0.23-RC4

Changes:
* Remove unused `debug` from the `log` section of the config file as it was unused.
* Update to Java 17.
* Fix plugin reloading (fingers crossed! `/chunk admin reload` *should* work!).
* Try to fix dragon eggs teleporting from claimed chunks.
* Add `preventAdjacent` list to world profiles to prevent chest connections if owned by different players (or unclaimed into claimed).
* If a message from the `messages.json` file is empty, it won't be sent.

As always please report any bugs you find to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cjburkey01/ClaimChunk/issues) or our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/swW8xX665Z).
